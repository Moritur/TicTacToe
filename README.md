# TicTacToe
 
A simple project meant to showcase my code style and architecture skills.

This basic implementation of tic-tac-toe game showcases solid architecture, good separation of concerns, high modularity, unit test coverage for some of the features and extensive use of dependency injection.

All code in this repository is well documented through comments in the code and consistent naming conventions. General high-level idea behind its structure is explained in this diagram:
